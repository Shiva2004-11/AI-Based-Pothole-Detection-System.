# AI-Based-Pothole-Detection-System.
🚧 Pothole Detection System:

Overview:
This project presents a Pothole Detection System that uses deep learning models for detecting potholes from uploaded images or live webcam captures.
It is built with Streamlit for a user-friendly web interface and integrates CNN and YOLOv8 models for classification and object detection.

Users can:

*Upload images or capture photos through the webcam

*Get pothole detection results with 3D visualization

*View detection history

*Analyze statistics and insights

*Generate downloadable PDF reports

*File complaints

*Provide feedback

Features:
✅ Upload an image for pothole detection.

✅ Capture live images using the webcam.

✅ CNN-based image classification.

✅ YOLOv8-based pothole object detection.

✅ LiDAR-style 3D visualization of road surfaces.

✅ Store and view detection history.

✅ Generate a detailed Pothole Detection Report in PDF format.

✅ Analyze statistics and insights from detections.

✅ File complaints via official portal.

✅ Collect user feedback for system improvement.

Tech Stack 🛠

Frontend: Streamlit

Deep Learning Models:

 *CNN (TensorFlow/Keras .h5 model)
 
 *YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)

Visualization:

 *OpenCV
 
 *Plotly
 
 *Matplotlib

Others:
 *FPDF for PDF generation
 
 *Pandas, NumPy for data handling
 
 *PIL for image processing

Dataset Description 📂

Uploaded Image Dataset:

 *Users upload road surface images.
 
 *Images undergo resizing (224x224) and normalization before being classified.
 
 *Predictions are made using both CNN (classification) and YOLOv8 (object detection).

Webcam Captured Dataset:

 *Images are captured in real-time using Streamlit's st.camera_input().
 
 *Captured images are converted into arrays, resized to 224x224, normalized, and processed live.
 
 *These dynamic images help in testing the robustness of the models against:
 
 *Different lighting conditions
    
 *Real-world road surface textures
    
 *Camera quality variations
    
 *No pre-labeling at capture time — used directly for live detection.

 Installation 🔧
 
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/pothole-detection-system.git

cd pothole-detection-system.

Install the required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Place the models:

 *Save your trained CNN model as pothole_classifier.h5.
 
 *Ensure yolov8n.pt (YOLOv8 Nano model) is present in the project folder.

Run the application:

streamlit run app.py
